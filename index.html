        <h2>Goals For The Next Two(2) Years In The Tech World</h2>
        <p>
            We have already made it through a month of 2024, but I know New Year’s resolutions are still on my mind. 
            We all have our personal goals — maybe they’re fitness related, career related, relationship related, or something else.
            Today, tech is central to the way businesses operate, and we need to give it the attention it needs. 
            After some thought, I have decided that there are five major tech goals and areas I should focus on for the next two years. 
            <ul>
                <p>
                    <li><span>Learn new programming languages:</span> There are many programming languages to learn as a beginner
                        in technology to enable you advance in your choosen niche. But sometimes could bve confusing as well as interesting.
                        I want to better my understanding of JavaScript using React and further build myself up using Vue and
                        other great JavaScript frameworks in the next couple of years to make me even better and stay relevant in the tech space. 
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><span>Strengthen soft skills:</span> The advantages of softskills cannot be emphasized enough. 
                        Softskills like public speaking and leadership skills helps one become a better communicator 
                        and a great leader as well as being able to communicate your thoughts to your audience.
                        What makes softskills interesting is the never ending learning path it comes with and I want to become
                        even better at them over the next two years.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><span>Networking:</span> Networking is a way of building networks and associating with like minds in the tech space.
                        This helps individuals grow and become better with their choosen profession. I want to become better at Networking
                        to enable me interact with great people that started before me in tech and those that are going to come after me over
                        the next two years.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><span>Contribute to open source projects:</span> Growing as a techie requires discipline and dedication
                        towards challenges that will help shape me as a great developer I wish to become. The best way to achieve the above
                        is constantly engaging in real-world projects and contributing to the developers community.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><span>Stay abreast of industry trends:</span> As a techie, staying abreast of industry trends is crucial to
                        your succcess. This will help me grow and understand the relevant technologies in use at a particular period.
                        Also, knowing the languages to advance on and the new features of already existing languages to help me grow
                        in the ever-evolving tech industry in the next years of my pursuit. 
                    </li>
